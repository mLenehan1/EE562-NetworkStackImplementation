\subsection{6LoWPAN}

6LoWPAN is an implementation of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
Networks. The ability to implement IPv6 on low power devices allows for the
inclusion of these low power devices in Internet of Things networks. 6LoWPAN is
a layer 3 protocol, and specifies fragmentation, compression, and meshing
implementations required for IPv6 using the 802.15.4
standard\cite{ott_2012}\cite{schmidt_2017}.

Implementing 6LoWPAN on small connected devices increases the maintainability of
these devices, and their security implementations. Standard network
administration tools such as ssh can be utilised by engineers in order to
connect to these devices remotely\cite{ott_2012}.

A number of IoT operating systems have support for 6LoWPAN, including TinyOS,
Contiki, and RIOT\cite{schmidt_2017}. These operating systems support the
standard to various degrees, with many implementations still being under
developement.
