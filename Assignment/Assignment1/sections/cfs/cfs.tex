\subsection{Completely Fair Scheduler}

The completely fair scheduler is the currently used scheduling algorithm in the
Linux kernel. The algorithm was merged into the codebase for the release of
version 2.6.23 (current release is 5.5.4) This scheduling algorithm is based on
CPU power sharing, rather than CPU time sharing, as used in O(1) scheduling.

CFS utilises ``Red-Black'' trees in order to map the execution order of queued
processes. The process at the leftmost node in the tree represents the process
which is to be allocated resources, with new processes being added to the right
of this node. The tree is traversed, with each process being given a
predetermined amount of time. This use of red-black trees allows for the removal
of the arrays used for tracking processes in O(1)
scheduling\cite{linuxKernelArchives}.
