\subsection{Recent Updates}

The CFS mechanism, as with the entire Linux kernel, is being updated for
maintenance or improvements. The most recent updates have included reducing the
``maximum time per-request''. This modification, which is expected to be
implemented in kernel version 5.7.x, reduces the average per-request performance
to 10ms, and the worst-case timings to 21ms\cite{larabel_2020}.
