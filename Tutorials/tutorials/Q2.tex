\textbf{Q. Describe, with the aid of a diagram, the Netfilter architecture for packet
processing in the Linux kernel. List the available hook points and hook function
verdicts. Which of these could be used to stop ICMP messages traversing a
Linux-based soft router?}

\textbf{A.}

\textbf{Q. Write a program in C that will implement a fireqall as a dynamically loadable
kernel module on a Linux host acting as a web server. The purpose of the module
is to prevent web browsers located outside the CIDR block 136.206.0.0/16 from
accessing the server, whose IP address is "136.206.1.2". (You may assume that
all necessary include files are loaded by including "whatever.h"). What changes
to your code would be needed if it were to be installed instead on a gateway
router (interconnecting the CIDR block and the wider internet)?}
