\textbf{Q. Write a program in C that will implement a firewall as a dynamically loadable
kernel module on a Linux host. The purpose of the module is to prevent traffic
from IP address "136.206.1.2" reaching any process running on the host, passing
all traffic. (You may assume that all necessary include files are loaded by
including "whatever.h") Will the firewall still work if the host uses a proxy
server for web access?}
